# Quiz Management System

## Project Overview
This is a simple **role-based quiz system** developed in Java. It supports two types of users:

- **Admin:** Can add multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to the question bank.
- **Student:** Can take a quiz composed of random MCQs from the question bank.

The system persists data using two JSON files:
- `users.json`: Stores user credentials and roles.
- `quiz.json`: Stores the MCQ question bank.
